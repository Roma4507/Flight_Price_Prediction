# Flight_Price_Prediction
Flight Price Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, departure time, number of stops, and destination. The dataset is processed and used to train a machine learning model to provide accurate price predictions.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for better model performance.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features to improve prediction accuracy.

Machine Learning Model: Implementing a Random Forest Regressor for prediction.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better performance.

The dataset contains various features affecting flight prices, such as:

Airline

Date of Journey

Source & Destination

Route

Departure & Arrival Time

Duration

Total Stops

Additional Information

Model Training

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations.

Implement a Random Forest Regressor for price prediction.

Evaluate model performance using RMSE and R-squared scores.

Tune hyperparameters for better predictions.

Results

The Random Forest Regressor provides the following performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1293.76

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 3,970,273.24

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1992.55

These results indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting flight prices.
